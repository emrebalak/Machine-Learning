# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Projects.

Three machine learning lesson projects are here.

o In 'regression-classification' file you can find regression and classification models on different data sets.

o In 'gradient_descent' file you can find code for gradient descent for logistic regression and for l2 regularized logistic regression.

o In 'predicting-disorder(term-project)' file you can find Decision Tree Algorithm and some methods like feature selection and feature extraction with principal component analysis are applied on given training data.
